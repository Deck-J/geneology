# Decker Family Genealogy

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive genealogy of the Decker family, tracing its roots from **John de Decker**, a Dutch statesman, to **Peter Decker (~1710-1775)**, the founder of Deckertown (now Sussex Borough, NJ), and through subsequent generations.

## **Origins of the Decker Family**

After this transition, many Dutch families, including the Deckers, moved inland to areas such as **Esopus (now Kingston, NY)** and later to **Minisink and Deckertown (now Sussex, NJ)**. 

The first confirmed settler in the Decker family line in Deckertown was **Peter Decker (~1710-1775)**, whose descendants played a significant role in the development of **Sussex County, NJ, and later migrated to Pennsylvania and beyond**.
