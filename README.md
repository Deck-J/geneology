# Decker Family Genealogy

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive genealogy of the Decker family, tracing its roots from **John de Decker**, a Dutch statesman, to **Peter Decker (~1710-1775)**, the founder of Deckertown (now Sussex Borough, NJ), and through subsequent generations. This includes land records, historical migrations, and significant family members.

## **Origins of the Decker Family**
The Decker family traces its roots back to **John de Decker**, a Dutch statesman who served as a **Counselor of State under Governor Peter Stuyvesant** during the Dutch colonial period. He was instrumental in **negotiating the surrender of New Amsterdam to the English in 1664**, which led to the establishment of British rule in what later became **New York**. After this transition, many Dutch families, including the Deckers, moved inland to areas such as **Esopus (now Kingston, NY)** and later to **Minisink and Deckertown (now Sussex, NJ)**.

The first confirmed settler in the Decker family line in Deckertown was **Peter Decker (~1710-1775)**, whose descendants played a significant role in the development of **Sussex County, NJ, and later migrated to Pennsylvania and beyond**.
